# virtual-garden

**A basic python program which allows you to get the information of different types of plants also you can add data of new plant**


## How it works
1. if you want to get information about any plant the program will find the file with the name of the plant , if the file is not present then it will print not found
2. if you want to add data first it will create a file by name of that plant , if the file is already created then it will stop the program else it will ask you the information which will be stored in the file created

ex : here we have only rose and lotus info if you want to add information about lily it will tell you not found
